# Civilizations
A plugin that completely overhauls the villagers system and turns it into more of a Civilization that will
grow from dirt to ultimately entire cities. Allows villagers to perform more actions
and communicate. 

## Todo list
1. Figuring out a way to provide context for methods
2. Creating wrappers for classes we require clear access to
3. Improve navigation for bigger distances
4. Make miners take safety measures
5. Create more careers (Lumberjack, Fisher, Builder, Transporter, Farmer, Butcher, Herder...)
6. Adapt more villager from NMS to our structure
7. Add more instincts (lava, running from zombies, sleepy time, swimming)
8. Make chests interactable and lock them for only villagers to access
9. Figure out what to do with crafting tables/furnaces
10. How to create farmland
11. Spawn pathing and biome assignments
12. Mining pathing (trace back up if they fall slightly, find a structure for the to follow so they can path up)
13. Create a town hall where villagers can store/retrieve resources
14. Create levels/implement natural selection (Genetic Algortithms?) Where do we need RNG to help natural selection?
15. Figure out more about how NMS works and what we can modify
16. Look into trading (what do they trade, how are item costs evaluated)
17. Look into storing buildings for them to recreate
18. Do we need an 'accountant' that takes care of the global resource track or do we just have this information for every villager
19. Think about player interaction, what are they allowed to do and what not
20. Think about starter packs for biomes
21. Define what profession can do what exactly (can a settler build a chest)
22. Figure out what requirements we need for breeding
23. Find out how to actually build structures
24. Town hall size/chest overflow
25. When do we want to start trading
26. How do we decide when we need to request help from other villagers
27. Figure out currency (is it going to be an actual currency early on or just resource trading)
28. Classify materials
